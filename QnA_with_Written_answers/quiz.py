"""
sample `questions.txt` file:
3**3-2+1+2*2+9/3=33.0
2+2=4
8-4=4
task description:
- read from `questions.txt`
- for each question, print out the question and and wait for the user's answer
    for example, for the first question, print out: `1+1=`
- after the user answers all the questions, calculate her score and write it to the `result.txt` file
    the result should be in such format: `Your final score is n/m.`
    where n and m are the number of correct answers and the maximum score respectively

# read all lines and get rid of line break for each line, then append each stripped line to a list
question_list = [line.strip() for line in questions]
questions.close()

score = 0  # initialize score
total = len(question_list)  # set total score

for line in question_list:
    # split equation with `=` into question and answer
    q, a = line.split("=")

    # print question and wait for user to input their answer
    ans = input(f"{q}=")

    if a == ans:  # if user input matches answer
        score += 1  # increase score
